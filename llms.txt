# Aura Platform: Autonomous Economic Negotiation

Aura is a microservices platform designed for AI agents to perform autonomous search and price negotiation with service providers.

## Main Tools & Capabilities

- **Search (Semantic)**: Agents can find items using natural language queries powered by vector similarity search (PostgreSQL/pgvector).
- **Negotiate**: Agents can submit bids for items. The platform uses a DSPy-trained ML engine to make intelligent decisions (accept, counter-offer, reject, or request UI approval).
- **Crypto Payments**: Supports locked deals that are revealed only after on-chain payment (Solana).

## Authentication & Security

All agents must sign their HTTP requests to the API Gateway using Ed25519 signatures.
- **Identity**: Agents are identified by DIDs (`did:key:public_key_hex`).
- **Headers**:
  - `X-Agent-ID`: The agent's DID.
  - `X-Timestamp`: Unix timestamp of the request.
  - `X-Signature`: Ed25519 signature of `METHOD + PATH + TIMESTAMP + BodyHash`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /v1/search`: Find items by query.
- `POST /v1/negotiate`: Submit a bid for an item.
- `POST /v1/deal/status`: Check if a crypto-locked deal has been paid and reveal the secret.

## Architecture Summary

- **Core Service**: gRPC backend for business logic and negotiation.
- **API Gateway**: Secure REST entry point for external agents.
- **Adapters**: Includes an MCP Server for native integration with Claude/Cursor and a Telegram Bot for manual interaction.
