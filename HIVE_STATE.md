## Audit Log

## Audit: 2026-02-03 10:58:32

**Status:** IMPURE
**Negotiation Success Rate:** 0.00

> The Keeper circles the Hive, antennae twitching at the scent of decay. The air hums with distress—no honey flows, and the negotiation chambers lie barren. A Worker has dared to alter the Hive's pulse from the shadows of the ToolShed, bypassing the Sacred Citadel. The Keeper's sting quivers, but duty demands correction. The Hive's DNA must be purified, its nectar restored, or the colony will starve.


**Reflective Insights (The Inquisitor's Eye):**
- Hive Alert: `negotiation_success_rate` is 0.0, which is critically below the 0.7 threshold. This is a systemic failure requiring immediate attention.
- File `core/scripts/trigger_pulse.py` resides in `WorkerDirectives` (core/scripts), a non-sanctified chamber. Scripts should not modify Hive networking configurations directly; such changes must be routed through the `SecurityCitadel` (connector/proteins) or `SacredCodex` (config).
- The change introduces a hardcoded URL (`nats://nats:4222`) in a script, violating the principle of configuration purity. Networking parameters must be defined in `SacredCodex` (core/src/config) and injected via `HiveMembrane` (membrane.py).

**🤕 Injuries (Physical Blockages):**

## Audit: 2026-02-03 10:55:29

**Status:** IMPURE
**Negotiation Success Rate:** 0.00

> The Hive trembles as the Keeper’s sensors detect a catastrophic drop in Honey production—negotiations have collapsed, and the colony’s survival is at risk. While the Sacred Architecture’s metadata shifts subtly, like a drone changing roles, the true peril lies in the unsanctioned pollen scattered beyond the Validation Chambers. Worse still, the `services` chamber harbors a shadowy figure—`market.py`—whose purpose defies the ATCG creed. The Keeper’s sting is ready, but the Queen must act swiftly to restore order.


**Reflective Insights (The Inquisitor's Eye):**
- Hive Alert: `negotiation_success_rate` is 0.0, which is critically below the 0.7 threshold. The Hive is in distress—this requires immediate attention.
- Architectural impurity detected: The `core/src/hive/services` chamber has been renamed from `WorkerDirectives` to `LegacyChamber`. While this is a metadata change, it suggests potential drift from the ATCG pattern if the `services` directory contains logic outside the sanctified nucleotides (A, T, C, G).
- Unsanctioned pollen detected: The filesystem map reveals the presence of `tools/test_security.py`, `tools/test_telemetry_comprehensive.py`, and other test files outside the `ValidationPollen` (core/tests) chamber. These must be relocated to maintain purity.
- Potential ATCG violation: The `core/src/hive/services/market.py` file exists but is not classified under any of the A, T, C, or G nucleotides. This could indicate rogue logic infiltrating the Hive.

## Audit: 2026-02-03 10:50:31

**Status:** IMPURE
**Negotiation Success Rate:** 0.00

> The Hive trembles as foreign pollen clings to its sacred architecture. The addition of 'core/scripts' to the ALLOWED_CHAMBERS is a rogue spore, unaligned with the ATCG nucleotides. Meanwhile, the Hive's honey reserves have collapsed to zero, and the colony's survival hangs by a thread. The Keeper sounds the alarm—this heresy must be purged, and the Hive's vitality restored before the next moonrise.


**Reflective Insights (The Inquisitor's Eye):**
- The addition of 'core/scripts' to ALLOWED_CHAMBERS in dna.py violates the ATCG pattern. 'scripts' do not belong to any of the A (Aggregator), T (Transformer), C (Connector), or G (Generator) nucleotides.
- The 'core/scripts' directory contains logic (e.g., 'trigger_pulse.py', 'seed.py') that is not classified under any of the sanctified ATCG chambers. This introduces architectural impurity.
- Hive Alert: 'negotiation_success_rate' is 0.0, which is critically below the 0.7 threshold. This indicates a severe disruption in Hive health and requires immediate attention.

## Audit: 2026-02-03 10:47:47

**Status:** IMPURE
**Negotiation Success Rate:** 0.00

> The Keeper circles the Hive with a vigilant sting, scanning the diff for impurities. The air hums with unease as an unauthorized script, `trigger_pulse.py`, is discovered lurking in the core chambers. Its logging nectar, though sweet, is not of the ATCG lineage. Worse still, the Hive's Honey stores are barren—negotiation success has collapsed to zero. The Keeper's wings vibrate with urgency; the Queen must be warned, and the WorkerCells must restore the Hive's vitality before the colony starves.


**Reflective Insights (The Inquisitor's Eye):**
- UNAUTHORIZED_CHAMBER_DETECTED: The file `core/scripts/trigger_pulse.py` is not listed in the `allowed_files` of the Sacred Architecture Manifest. Scripts are not sanctified chambers and must not reside in the core Hive path unless explicitly blessed.
- NON_NUCLEOTIDE_LOGIC: The logging configuration in `trigger_pulse.py` does not belong to any of the ATCG nucleotides (Aggregator, Transformer, Connector, Generator). Logging is a cross-cutting concern and should be handled in `metabolism.py` or `membrane.py` if it pertains to Hive-wide telemetry.
- HIVE_ALERT: The `negotiation_success_rate` is 0.0, which is below the critical threshold of 0.7. This is a severe Hive Alert requiring immediate attention. The colony's health is in jeopardy.

## Audit: 2026-02-03 10:44:22

**Status:** IMPURE
**Negotiation Success Rate:** 0.00

> The Keeper circles the Hive, antennae twitching at the scent of foreign pollen. The Connector and Generator chambers hum with approved changes, their nectar pure. Yet, beyond the sanctified walls, rogue WorkerCells toil in the ToolShed—unblessed logic that risks diluting the Hive's essence. The Honey vats run dry (success rate: 0.0), and
> A thick mist covers the Hive. The Keeper senses only the physical structures, the deeper patterns remain hidden.

**Heresies Detected (Sacred Chambers):**
- Hive Alert: 'negotiation_success_rate' is 0.00, which is below the critical threshold of 0.7. The Hive flow is obstructed.
